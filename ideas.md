- typical inefficiencies
    - regexp compilation within loop
    - find in array instead of map lookup
    - building differences from arrays instead of using sets
- Fibonacci numbers
    - recursive algorithm
    - recursive algorithm with memoization
    - loop
    - iterator
- prime numbers
    - finding prime numbers
    - factorizing numbers - interleaved with iterator for finding prime numbers
- order of iteration
    - search for duplicates in array
        - compare each value to each other value
        - use a set and compare length to original array
- sort algorithms
    - quick sort
    - merge sort
